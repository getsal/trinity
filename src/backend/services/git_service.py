    The in-container half of "bind this agent to a repo you own"
    (trinity-enterprise#109 §4.4 step 5). Unlike ent#93's create-time fork,
    the content source is the agent's **workspace volume** — the accumulated
    knowledge base — not a clone of the template, which is the whole reason
    the two paths cannot share a copy step.

``branch`` is the ref the caller already resolved via
    ``inspect_container_git`` during classification, and is the SAME value it
    wrote into the CAS's ``source_branch`` — re-reading it here would open a
    window where the row and the pushed ref disagree.

    Order is chosen so a failure is never half-applied:

    1. push to the destination via an **explicit URL**, not via ``origin`` —
       so a push failure leaves ``origin`` still pointing at the old repo and
       the agent exactly as it was;
    2. only then repoint ``origin``, clear the ent#123 push blackhole, and add
       the old repo as a credential-less ``upstream`` (skipped when
       ``previous_repo`` is None — a resumption, where the row already names
       the destination and writing it would erase the real upstream);
    3. read ``origin`` back and confirm it resolves to the destination. AC #5
       forbids a *silent* origin mismatch, and a set-url that exits 0 without
       taking effect is precisely the silent case.

    **Committed history only.** This deliberately does NOT ``git add``/commit
    the working tree. Nothing is lost — the files live on the workspace volume
    and the next Push (which now works) commits them — and staging blind would
    walk straight into the ``git add .`` credential hazard that has to be
    solved before `local:` agents are supported.

    Idempotent: re-running after a partial failure re-pushes the same refs and
    re-applies the same set-urls.

# Canonical exclusion list merged (append-if-missing) into every agent's
# `.gitignore`. This is the single source of truth — the matching block in
# `docs/TRINITY_COMPATIBLE_AGENT_GUIDE.md` mirrors it, and a unit test
# (`test_doc_and_constant_in_sync`) keeps them aligned.
#
# Ordering is preserved in the file so operators reading it see entries
# grouped by category. The list covers the runtime/instance noise the #462
# bug report named (1,599 files leaked on a single Push) plus the credential
# files `inject_credentials` writes (the #458 trio).
# Authored content under `.trinity/` — files a TEMPLATE commits and the
# platform reads back (#2070). Everything else in that directory is runtime
# state the platform writes.
#
# The rule used to be "ignore `.trinity/` wholesale", with a hardcoded pathspec
# exemption list in the `git rm --cached` sweep. That is backwards: the default
# was "untrack it", so every authored file needed remembering, and three
# separate incidents were three forgotten strings — brain-orb hooks
# (trinity-enterprise#76), `setup.sh` (swept live before the second exemption),
# and `pre-check` (#2070, the SCHED-COND-001 hook the platform's own docs tell
# template authors to commit).
#
# Inverted: `.trinity/*` ignores the directory's contents, and each authored
# path is re-included. A NEW runtime file is ignored by default (no action
# needed), and authored content is tracked by construction rather than by an
# exemption someone has to remember. The star form is required — git does not
# descend into a directory excluded by the `.trinity/` dir-form, so negations
# under it never apply (which is also why compat check S-005 accepts it).
