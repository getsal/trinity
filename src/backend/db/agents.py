        (#1664).

        The volume-identity counterpart of :meth:`is_agent_name_reserved`, and
        the ONLY safe orphan predicate for the #1581 volume sweep. A volume
        describes itself by name and by its immutable ``trinity.agent-name``
        label, but Docker can rename neither — so after an agent rename BOTH
        carry the pre-rename name while the volume is still the live agent's
        home. Asking "is this *name* an agent?" therefore answers the wrong
        question and marks live data an orphan; asking "does any agent own
        volumes under this base?" answers the right one.

        A row owns volumes under BOTH of its identities — the check is a
        UNION, not a switch:

        - ``agent_name``: NULL ``volume_base_name`` means "same as agent_name"
          (every agent that was never renamed, so no backfill is needed), AND
          a renamed agent still creates *new* volumes under its CURRENT name —
          `get_public_volume_name` / `get_shared_volume_name` are called with
          the live name, so enabling file-sharing after a rename produces
          `agent-{new}-public`. A renamed agent therefore legitimately owns
          volumes under two bases, and the public volume is unmounted whenever
          file-sharing is off — matching only the pin would mark that live
          agent's shared files an orphan and delete them.
        - ``volume_base_name``: the pre-rename base its workspace kept.

        Union-of-both is also strictly safer than the pre-#1664 predicate it
        replaces (`is_agent_name_reserved` ≡ the first branch alone), so this
        can only protect more than before, never less. A purged row matches
        neither, so a genuine orphan is still reclaimable.

        ``exclude_agent`` ignores one row — pass the agent that is ASKING, so
        the question becomes "does anyone ELSE claim this base?" (#1671). The
        rename gate needs it: an agent renamed ``B``→``A`` keeps pin ``B``, so
        renaming it back to ``B`` must be allowed (it already owns that base,
        and the result has exactly one claimant). Without the exclusion that
        legitimate rename-back is refused, and told its own volumes belong to
        someone else.

        rotating a parent's key silently severs parenthood for every child it
        spawned — unrecoverably, because the old id is gone.

        Keyed on ``!= :current_id``, deliberately NOT ``= :old_id``:

        * ``get_agent_mcp_api_key`` is ``ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1``, so
          the moment the new key commits it returns the NEW id — re-reading it
          to build an ``= :old_id`` predicate makes the UPDATE a no-op.
        * #1811 recorded 50 accumulated active rows on one instance, so children
          can be stranded on any of several superseded ids; only the ``!=`` form
          converges them.

        Idempotent and convergent: it repairs children stranded by an earlier
        crashed rotation, and serves the rollback direction too (after the
        superseded rows are deleted, the surviving key is newest-active again).

        Security: the predicate is scoped to ``spawned_by_agent = :agent`` —
        rows whose provenance ALREADY names this parent, written server-side at
        creation. It cannot grant parenthood over an agent this parent never
        spawned, and it does not widen the gate's matching rule (relaxing
        ``enforce_agent_spawn_scope`` to accept "any active key" was rejected:
        that edits shared auth code on behalf of one caller's transient state).
